// Should this PR squash-merge without a human?
//
// Cursor Cloud Agents open a DRAFT PR before they finish testing (they have to:
// the environment asks them to push a pre-testing revision). CI can go green on
// that draft while the agent is still proving the change against the scratch
// stack. Auto-merging on CI alone would land unverified agent work.
//
// Draft is the verification gate. Ready-for-review means the agent (or a human)
// ran verify-vscode. That is still a self-attestation — it is not a substitute
// for CI or for Greptile. GitHub then squash-merges only when:
//
//   1. The named CI jobs are green AND came from github-actions running the
//      expected workflow PATHS (not a same-name job in a PR-added workflow).
//   2. Those workflow files were not edited in the PR — otherwise the PR can
//      gut ci.yml, keep the job names, and present a trivial success.
//   3. Greptile has finished a pass on this PR, with confidence 5/5 and
//      zero P1 comments. Greptile's check-run conclusion is "we reviewed",
//      not "safe to merge" — it reports success even at 1/5 with P1s.
//   4. A verify-vscode attestation names THIS head SHA. Ready-for-review was
//      only ever a self-attestation that nothing read; this makes it a
//      machine-checked one. It does not prove the agent drove the app — it
//      cannot — but it does turn a silent omission into an explicit claim,
//      and it kills the stale-proof case: verify commit A, push commit B, and
//      the attestation no longer matches the head SHA.
//
// Fail closed: a missing name, a missing app, a missing Greptile summary, a
// missing or stale verification attestation, or a privileged-path edit does
// not merge.
